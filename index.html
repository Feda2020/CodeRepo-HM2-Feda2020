<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I started out as a self-taught artist and then attended Mhanna El Durra Fine Art training center 
    in Amman – Jordan from 2005 - 2007. Then I moved to San Antonio in 2010 where I participated in 
    many art exhibits around this amazing city. I am inspired by the stories of life around us which 
    I try to convey as a visual artistic expression. In my art, I like to focus on eyes because they 
    are the place where our deepest emotions hide and if you look deep enough you can see people’s 
    soul. I’m also fascinated with the human body; I’m a detailed portrait artist and like to use 
    pencils, colored pencils, markers and ink to create intricate details. When I connect with the 
    stories I draw is when I do be and this is what gives my art work a unique meaningful feel to it.</p>
